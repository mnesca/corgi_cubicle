## Motivation(s) & Objectives

The idea of this practice dataset is:  
  1) to upkeep my data science skills in R  
  2) playing with version control using Github  
  3) Store my thoughts on data analysis  
  4) i want to practice more on Tidyverse code and stop using BASE R coding  


```{r loading packages, include=FALSE}
library(here) 
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading Datasets

I have obtained this dataset from the City of Winnipeg open dataset archive I will be concentrating on utilizing the Transit-passups for this practice project.  Since this dataset gets updated daily, I have gotten this dataset in June 29th 2019.

Ref: <https://data.winnipeg.ca/Transit/Transit-Pass-ups/mer2-irmb>

```{r loading data, include=TRUE}
transitdata <- read_csv(here("data", "Transit_Pass-ups.csv"))
```
