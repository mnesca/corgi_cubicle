## Motivation(s) & Objectives

The idea of this practice dataset is:
  1) to upkeep my data science skills in R 
  2) playing with version control using Github
  3) Store my thoughts on data analysis
  4) i want to practice more on Tidyverse code and stop using BASE R coding


```{r loading packages, include=TRUE}
library(here) 
## *Here package* is supposed to find the project path that you are working off of
## A good reference is this github page <https://github.com/jennybc/here_here>
library(rmarkdown)
```

## Problems and Issues
1) how to save R Markdown files on github.

```{r issues to solve, include = TRUE}
## 1) need to install rmarkdown package then change the yaml output: github_document
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
