A Winnipegger doing casual data analysis

UPDATE 06-29-2019:
  - opened up my own repository
  - i believe i connected R with Github... now i have to test it somehow which i wish i knew how! -- ill eventually figure it out.


I'm a beginner data scientist, i am using this repository to practice and get tips for coding.  All i know is that i love data analysis and i just want to increase my skills in R, Statistics, Coding, and yes utilizing GitHub -- so I am using this opportunity to make a public repository, ask interesting questions on open datasets.  

For now im sticking with Canadian open data sources:
  https://data.winnipeg.ca/  -- i am currently going to be doing analysis on transit data.
