A Winnipegger doing casual data analysis

I'm a beginner data scientist, i am using this repository to practice and get tips for coding.  All i know is that i love data analysis and i just want to increase my skills in R, Statistics, Coding, and yes utilizing GitHub -- so I am using this opportunity to make a public repository, ask interesting questions on open datasets.  

For now im sticking with Canadian open data sources:
  https://data.winnipeg.ca/  -- i am currently going to be doing analysis on transit data.

UPDATE 07-22-2019:
  - General thoughts, so now im getting used to coding in the tidyverse, and applying these to github which is super cool in my opinion. I am currently studying text mining and NLP for my thesis, my goal is to try to apply it here. Overall however, i do not believe i have unleashed the full potential of Github, i wish to tap into some resources that can teach me the full capability of github.  However, overall I really love R as a programming language, its very comfortable, and truly a full data scientist kit! 

UPDATE 07-07-2019:
  - Ive been getting into my dataset now, a couple questions were raised about the data, such as "Can i use R to connect to relational databases?" or even "how do i use APIs with R?" ---- as i dive deeper into the rabbit hole....

UPDATE 07-02-2019:
  - Okay it seems to work!! super proud! 1 step closer to a data scientist! :)


UPDATE 06-29-2019:
  - opened up my own repository
  - i believe i connected R with Github... now i have to test it somehow which i wish i knew how! -- ill eventually figure it out.
